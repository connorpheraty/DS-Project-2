# Kaggle Challenge! Predicting Faulty Water Pumps

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we are tasked with predicting the functionality of water pumps scattered across Tanzania. Our objective is to create a model that will help identify what features contribute the most for the pumps becoming faulty so that the ministry of water can improve maintenance operations and ensure water is available for all citizens across the country. <br>

This challenge was hosted by drivendata and further details can be found [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). The challenge summary is as follows: <br>
> **Can you predict which water pumps are faulty?**

> Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania. 

In this repo you will find the three csv files (train, test, and target) along with the python notebook containing the model.
